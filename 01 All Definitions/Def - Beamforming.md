**[[Def - Beamforming|Beamforming]]** is a signal processing technique used in wireless communication to focus radio signals in specific directions, rather than broadcasting them uniformly in all directions. By adjusting the phase and amplitude of the signals sent or received by multiple antennas, the transmitter or receiver can create constructive interference in desired directions and destructive interference elsewhere.

[[Def - Beamforming|Beamforming]] is a key feature of **Massive MIMO ([[Def - (mMIMO) Massive MIMO|mMIMO]])** and is widely used in **4G [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]]**, **[[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]]**, and **WiFi** to improve signal quality, reduce interference, and increase network capacity.

Types of beamforming:
- **Analog beamforming**: Adjusts signal phases in hardware ([[Def - (RF) Radio Frequency|RF]] domain).
- **Digital beamforming**: Processes signals in baseband with more precision and flexibility.
- **Hybrid beamforming**: Combines analog and digital approaches for efficiency.

Key benefits:
- **Stronger signals**: Enhances coverage and throughput at the user end.
- **Reduced interference**: Minimises leakage into unintended directions.
- **Better spectrum use**: Enables spatial reuse and multi-user transmissions.

[[Def - Beamforming|Beamforming]] is essential for high-performance wireless systems, especially in challenging environments like urban centres or indoor venues.
