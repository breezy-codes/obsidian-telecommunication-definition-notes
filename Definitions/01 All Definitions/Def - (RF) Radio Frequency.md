**Radio Frequency ([[Def - (RF) Radio Frequency|RF]])** refers to the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum used for wireless communication. In mobile networks, [[Def - (RF) Radio Frequency|RF]] signals are used to carry data between the User Equipment ([[Def - (UE) User Equipment|UE]]) and the Radio Access Network ([[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]]) over the air interface.

RF encompasses a broad range of frequencies, from below 1 GHz up to tens of GHz, including:
- **Sub-1 GHz**: Offers long-range coverage and better penetration.
- **Sub-6 GHz**: Balances coverage and capacity, widely used in 4G and early 5G.
- **[[Def - (mmWave) millimetre wave|mmWave]] (millimetre wave)**: Provides ultra-high capacity but has short range and is sensitive to obstruction.

Key aspects of [[Def - (RF) Radio Frequency|RF]] in mobile networks:
- **Modulation**: Converts digital signals into [[Def - (RF) Radio Frequency|RF]] waveforms (and vice versa).
- **Power control**: Adjusts transmission power to maintain quality and minimise interference.
- **Antenna systems**: Use technologies like [[Def - (MIMO) Multiple Input Multiple Output|MIMO]] and beamforming to focus [[Def - (RF) Radio Frequency|RF]] energy.

Effective [[Def - (RF) Radio Frequency|RF]] design and planning are essential for ensuring good coverage, capacity, and signal quality in mobile communication networks.
