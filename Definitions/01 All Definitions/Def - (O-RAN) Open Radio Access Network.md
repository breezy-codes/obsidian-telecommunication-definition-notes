**Open Radio Access Network ([[Def - (O-RAN) Open Radio Access Network|O-RAN]])** is a new approach to designing and deploying mobile networks where the **[[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]] components are disaggregated and interoperable**, allowing operators to mix and match hardware and software from different vendors.

Driven by the **[[Def - O-RAN Alliance|O-RAN Alliance]]**, this model replaces traditional, tightly integrated systems with open interfaces between the Radio Unit ([[Def - (RU) Radio Unit|RU]]), Distributed Unit ([[Def - (DU) Distributed Unit|DU]]), and Centralised Unit ([[Def - (CU) Centralised Unit|CU]]). It also introduces the **RAN Intelligent Controller ([[Def - (RIC) RAN Intelligent Controller|RIC]])** for programmability and optimisation.

Key principles of [[Def - (O-RAN) Open Radio Access Network|O-RAN]]:
- **Open interfaces**: Standardised APIs enable multi-vendor interoperability.
- **Disaggregated architecture**: Splits RAN functions into modular components.
- **Software-defined control**: Supports automation and dynamic optimisation via AI/ML.
- **Vendor neutrality**: Reduces lock-in and increases supply chain flexibility.

[[Def - (O-RAN) Open Radio Access Network|O-RAN]] accelerates innovation, lowers deployment costs, and supports customisable 5G network rollouts, particularly valuable in rural, enterprise, and private network use cases.
