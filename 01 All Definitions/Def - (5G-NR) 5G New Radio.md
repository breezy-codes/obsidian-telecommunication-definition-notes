**[[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]] (New Radio)** is the global wireless standard for the **radio access** part of 5G mobile networks, developed by **[[Def - (3GPP) 3rd Generation Partnership Project|3GPP]]**. It is designed to deliver ultra-fast speeds, low latency, and massive device connectivity across a wide range of use cases, from enhanced mobile broadband ([[Def - (eMBB) Enhanced Mobile Broadband|eMBB]]) to ultra-reliable low-latency communications ([[Def - (URLLC) Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications|URLLC]]), massive machine type communications ([[Def - (mMTC) Massive Machine-Type Communications|mMTC]]) and massive IoT.

[[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]] introduces new spectrum usage, including:
- **Sub-6 GHz** bands for broader coverage
- **[[Def - (mmWave) millimetre wave|mmWave]]** bands for extremely high data rates over short distances

Key features of [[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]]:
- **Flexible numerology**: Supports multiple subcarrier spacings for different service types.
- **Dynamic TDD**: Allows uplink and downlink to share spectrum flexibly.
- **Beamforming and massive MIMO ([[Def - (mMIMO) Massive MIMO|mMIMO]])**: Improves signal quality and capacity.
- **Standalone (SA) and Non-Standalone (NSA)** deployment modes**: SA uses a 5G core; NSA uses an existing 4G core.

[[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]] forms the foundation of modern wireless infrastructure, enabling new services such as smart factories, AR/VR, connected vehicles, and advanced broadband experiences.
