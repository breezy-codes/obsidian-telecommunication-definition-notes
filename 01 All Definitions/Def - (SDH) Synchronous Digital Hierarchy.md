**Synchronous Digital Hierarchy ([[Def - (SDH) Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]])** is a standard for transmitting digital signals over optical or electrical networks in a highly structured and synchronised way. It was developed to unify and replace older transmission systems, making it easier to interconnect equipment from different vendors and countries.

In [[Def - (SDH) Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]], data is organised into fixed-size frames and sent at synchronised intervals. This allows for predictable timing, easy multiplexing, and reliable transport of voice, video, and data services.

Key features of [[Def - (SDH) Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]]:
- **Standardised frame structure**: Simplifies equipment design and interoperability.
- **High precision timing**: All network elements follow a global clock, reducing jitter and delay.
- **Multiplexing**: Combines multiple lower-rate signals into higher-capacity streams (e.g. STM-1, STM-4).
- **Management channels**: Built-in overheads support monitoring, alarms, and maintenance.

[[Def - (SDH) Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]] is widely used in long-haul and metropolitan transport networks, especially for carrying legacy services and connecting to other systems like SONET (used in North America). While newer technologies like [[Def - (OTN) Optical Transport Network|OTN]] and Ethernet are now more common, [[Def - (SDH) Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]] remains in use due to its reliability and mature infrastructure.
