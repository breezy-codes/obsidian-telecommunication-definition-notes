**[[Def - (MIMO) Multiple Input Multiple Output|MIMO]] (Multiple Input Multiple Output)** is a wireless communication technique that uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve data throughput, reliability, and spectral efficiency. It is a core technology in modern wireless standards such as [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]], 5G, and WiFi.

[[Def - (MIMO) Multiple Input Multiple Output|MIMO]] works by exploiting multipath propagation, where signals bounce off surfaces and take different paths, to transmit multiple data streams simultaneously over the same frequency band. These streams are then separated at the receiver using advanced signal processing.

There are several types of [[Def - (MIMO) Multiple Input Multiple Output|MIMO]] configurations:
- **Spatial multiplexing**: Increases data rate by sending different data streams across multiple antennas.
- **Beamforming**: Directs signals towards specific users to enhance signal quality and reduce interference.
- **Diversity schemes**: Improves reliability by sending the same data across different antennas and combining signals at the receiver.

Key benefits of [[Def - (MIMO) Multiple Input Multiple Output|MIMO]] include:
- **Higher capacity**: Enables higher data rates without needing additional spectrum.
- **Improved coverage**: Beamforming focuses energy, extending range and penetration.
- **Robustness**: Better performance in challenging environments with interference or obstacles.

Advanced forms such as **Massive MIMO ([[Def - (mMIMO) Massive MIMO|mMIMO]])** use large antenna arrays (e.g. 64, 128, or more) at base stations to serve multiple users simultaneously, which is essential for meeting the demands of 5G and beyond.
