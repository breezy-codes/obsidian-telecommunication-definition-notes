**[[Def - (GSM) Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] (Global System for Mobile Communications)** is a second-generation (2G) digital cellular network standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). It became the foundation for mobile voice and low-speed data services across much of the world, replacing first-generation analogue systems.

[[Def - (GSM) Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] operates primarily in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz frequency bands (with 850 MHz and 1900 MHz used in some regions) and uses **Time Division Multiple Access ([[Def - (TDM) Time Division Multiplexing|TDM]])** to allow multiple users to share the same frequency channel.

Key features of [[Def - (GSM) Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] include:
- **Digital voice transmission** for clearer audio and better spectrum efficiency.
- **SIM cards** for portable subscriber identity and access control.
- **International roaming** across compatible networks.
- **Basic data services** like SMS and Circuit-Switched Data (CSD).

It also defined a layered protocol architecture including:
- **Base Station Subsystem (BSS)** for radio access.
- **Network Switching Subsystem (NSS)** for call control and mobility.
- **Operation Support System (OSS)** for network management.

[[Def - (GSM) Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] laid the groundwork for mobile evolution, enabling enhancements like GPRS, [[Def - (EDGE) Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]], and eventually transition to 3G and 4G technologies.
