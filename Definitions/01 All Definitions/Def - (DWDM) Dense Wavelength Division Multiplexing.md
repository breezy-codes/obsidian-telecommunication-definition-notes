**Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]])** is a type of [[Def - (WDM) Wavelength Division Multiplexing|Wavelength Division Multiplexing]] that enables very high-capacity transmission by packing a large number of closely spaced optical channels onto a single fibre. It is commonly used in long-haul and high-traffic networks such as inter-city links, undersea cables, and data centre backbones.

In [[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]] systems, each channel is assigned a wavelength with very narrow spacing typically 0.8 nm, 0.4 nm, or even tighter. This allows dozens or even hundreds of channels to coexist on the same fibre without interfering with each other. Each channel can carry data rates from 10 Gbps to 400 Gbps or more, depending on the transceivers and modulation used.

A [[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]] system includes:
- **Transponders**: Convert incoming electrical signals to optical signals at specific wavelengths.
- **Multiplexers and demultiplexers**: Combine and split optical channels for transmission and reception.
- **Optical amplifiers** (e.g. Erbium-Doped Fibre Amplifiers ([[Def - (EDFA) Erbium-Doped Fibre Amplifier|EDFA]])): Boost signal strength over long distances without converting to electrical signals.
- **Wavelength-selective switches**: Allow dynamic reconfiguration of the optical path in reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers ([[Def - (ROADM) Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer|ROADM]]s).

Key characteristics of [[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]]:
- **High spectral efficiency**: Makes the most of the available fibre bandwidth.
- **Long-distance performance**: Supports transmission over hundreds or thousands of kilometres with minimal degradation.
- **Protocol transparency**: Can carry different types of data (e.g. Ethernet, SONET, Fibre Channel) simultaneously.

[[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]] is essential for scaling core network capacity, supporting the growing demand for high-speed internet, cloud computing, and data-intensive applications.
