# Obsidian Telecommunication & Network Definitions

Welcome to the ultimate collection of telecommunications and networking definitions, curated for seamless integration with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)!

This repository offers an extensive, well-organised set of notes and explanations covering the full spectrum of telecommunications and computer networking. Whether you're a student, engineer, researcher, or enthusiast, you'll find detailed definitions, protocol breakdowns, technology overviews, and conceptual guides designed to support learning and reference.

Key features include:

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Hundreds of definitions spanning protocols, standards, technologies, acronyms, architectures, and more.
- **Obsidian-Optimised Structure**: Notes are formatted for easy navigation, linking, and search within Obsidian, leveraging tags and aliases for efficient cross-referencing.
- **Dataview Integration**: Category notes use Dataview queries to dynamically organise and display definitions by topic, tag, or alias.
- **Modular & Expandable**: The structure supports adding new definitions, updating existing ones, and customising views to fit your workflow.
- **Practical Utility**: Ideal for building a personal knowledge base, preparing for exams, onboarding new team members, or deepening your understanding of telecom and networking concepts.

Explore the repository to discover a powerful resource for mastering the language and technologies of modern communications.

## Contents Overview

The `Definitions` folder is the heart of this project. It is organised for easy navigation and includes:

- **01 All Definitions/**: Hundreds of individual definition notes (e.g., protocols, standards, technologies, acronyms) in Obsidian-friendly Markdown files.
- **01 Telecommunication Definitions.base**: An Obsidian Bases organiser file for Dataview, providing custom views and filters for exploring definitions by category or tag.
- **Network Protocols.md**: MOC for protocols and standards for data transmission and networking.
- **Network Tech and Concepts.md**: MOC for key technologies and concepts in networking.
- **Optical Network and Components.md**: MOC for optical networking terms and components.
- **RAN Architectures & Components.md**: MOC for radio Access Network architectures and elements.
- **Radio Protocols.md**: MOC for wireless and radio communication protocols.
- **Routing Multicast & Gateway Protocols.md**: MOC for routing, multicast, and gateway protocols.
- **Security & Authentication.md**: MOC for security, authentication, and cryptography definitions.
- **Standardisation & Organisations.md**: MOC for standards bodies and industry organisations.
- **Wireless Technologies.md**: MOC for wireless communication technologies and standards.

Each category note uses [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) queries to automatically list and organise definitions by tag and alias.
