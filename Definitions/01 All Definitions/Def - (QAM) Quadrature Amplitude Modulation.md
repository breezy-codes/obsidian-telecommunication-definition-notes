**Quadrature Amplitude Modulation ([[Def - (QAM) Quadrature Amplitude Modulation|QAM]])** is a digital modulation technique that combines **amplitude** and **phase** variation to represent data. It sends two signals—one in-phase (I) and one quadrature (Q)—on the same carrier frequency but 90° out of phase, allowing for efficient use of both dimensions.

By adjusting both the amplitude and phase of the carrier, [[Def - (QAM) Quadrature Amplitude Modulation|QAM]] can encode multiple bits per symbol. For example:
- **16-QAM**: 4 bits per symbol (16 distinct states)
- **64-QAM**: 6 bits per symbol
- **256-QAM**: 8 bits per symbol

Higher-order [[Def - (QAM) Quadrature Amplitude Modulation|QAM]] increases data rate but also requires higher signal quality, as the states are closer together and more sensitive to noise.

QAM is widely used in:
- **WiFi (802.11n/ac/ax)**
- **Digital TV**
- **Cable internet**
- **[[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]] and 5G networks**

[[Def - (QAM) Quadrature Amplitude Modulation|QAM]] provides a strong balance between spectral efficiency and performance, making it one of the most commonly used modulation schemes in modern broadband systems.
