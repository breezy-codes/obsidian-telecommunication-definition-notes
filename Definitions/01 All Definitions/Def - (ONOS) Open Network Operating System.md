**Open Network Operating System ([[Def - (ONOS) Open Network Operating System|ONOS]])** is an open-source, carrier-grade [[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]] controller developed by the **Open Networking Foundation ([[Def - (ONF) Open Networking Foundation|ONF]])**. It provides centralised control and real-time visibility over network devices and services, enabling programmability and automation in large-scale telecom and data centre networks.

[[Def - (ONOS) Open Network Operating System|ONOS]] is designed with a **distributed architecture**, ensuring high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance across network controllers.

Key features of [[Def - (ONOS) Open Network Operating System|ONOS]]:
- **Southbound support** for OpenFlow, NETCONF, and other device control protocols.
- **Northbound APIs** for application developers to build network control apps.
- **Intent-based networking**: Allows network behaviour to be defined through high-level intents rather than manual configurations.
- **Modular and extensible**: Supports plug-ins and service composition for different use cases.

[[Def - (ONOS) Open Network Operating System|ONOS]] is used in projects like **[[Def - (SEBA) SDN Enabled Broadband Access|SEBA]]** and **[[Def - (ODTN) Open Disaggregated Transport Network|ODTN]]**, where [[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]] principles are applied to broadband access and optical transport networks. It plays a central role in enabling open, disaggregated, and programmable network architectures.
