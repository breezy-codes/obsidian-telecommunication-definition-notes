**Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (CWDM) Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing|CWDM]])** is a type of **optical multiplexing technology** that enables multiple optical signals to be transmitted simultaneously over a single fibre by assigning each signal a **unique wavelength (colour) of light**. [[Def - (CWDM) Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing|CWDM]] is a cost-effective solution for expanding fibre capacity in **metro and access networks** without the need for laying new fibre.

[[Def - (CWDM) Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing|CWDM]] falls under the broader category of **Wavelength Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (WDM) Wavelength Division Multiplexing|WDM]])**, which includes both [[Def - (CWDM) Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing|CWDM]] and Dense WDM ([[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]]). Compared to [[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]], [[Def - (CWDM) Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing|CWDM]] uses **fewer, more widely spaced wavelengths**, resulting in **simpler and cheaper** equipment.

Key characteristics of [[Def - (CWDM) Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing|CWDM]]:
- **Wavelength spacing**: Typically 20 nm apart, using wavelengths from **1270 nm to 1610 nm**, supporting up to **18 channels**.
- **Uncooled lasers**: Due to wider spacing and tolerance for drift, [[Def - (CWDM) Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing|CWDM]] transceivers use uncooled lasers, reducing cost and power consumption.
- **Shorter range**: Designed for **short to medium-distance** applications (up to ~80 km without amplification).
- **Passive components**: Multiplexers and demultiplexers are passive optical devices with no power requirement.

Benefits of [[Def - (CWDM) Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing|CWDM]]:
- **Increased fibre capacity**: Transmits multiple data streams over one pair of fibres.
- **Cost efficiency**: Lower equipment costs make it ideal for enterprises, carriers, and ISPs expanding metro networks.
- **Protocol agnostic**: Supports multiple data rates and protocols (e.g. Ethernet, Fibre Channel, SDH/SONET).
- **Scalability**: Channels can be added incrementally as demand grows.

Common use cases:
- **Metro Ethernet backhaul**
- **Enterprise campus connectivity**
- **Fibre-to-the-business (FTTB)**
- **Mobile xHaul ([[Def - Fronthaul|fronthaul]], [[Def - Midhaul|midhaul]], [[Def - Backhaul|Backhaul]])**

[[Def - (CWDM) Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing|CWDM]] is often used in **access networks**, while **[[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]]** is preferred for **long-haul and core** applications due to its higher channel density and support for optical amplification.
