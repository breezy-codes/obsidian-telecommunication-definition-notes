**Wavelength Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (WDM) Wavelength Division Multiplexing|WDM]])** is a technique used in fibre-optic communication to transmit multiple signals simultaneously over a single optical fibre by using different wavelengths (colours) of light. Each signal is assigned a unique wavelength, and all are combined and sent together through the same fibre.

At the transmitting end, multiple lasers generate light at different wavelengths, each carrying a separate data stream. These are combined using a device called a multiplexer. At the receiving end, a demultiplexer separates the combined signal into its component wavelengths so each stream can be processed individually.

There are two main types of [[Def - (WDM) Wavelength Division Multiplexing|WDM]]:
- **Coarse WDM ([[Def - (CWDM) Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing|CWDM]])**: Uses fewer wavelengths spaced farther apart (typically 20 nm spacing), suitable for shorter distances and lower cost.
- **Dense WDM ([[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]])**: Supports many closely spaced wavelengths (as little as 0.8 nm apart), enabling high data capacity and long-distance transmission.

Key advantages of [[Def - (WDM) Wavelength Division Multiplexing|WDM]] include:
- **Increased capacity**: Allows a single fibre to carry many data channels at once.
- **Efficient use of infrastructure**: Reduces the need for laying additional fibres.
- **Scalability**: Makes it easier to expand network capacity by adding more wavelengths.

[[Def - (WDM) Wavelength Division Multiplexing|WDM]] is a foundational technology in modern optical networks, including backbone internet infrastructure, metropolitan area networks, and data centre interconnects.
