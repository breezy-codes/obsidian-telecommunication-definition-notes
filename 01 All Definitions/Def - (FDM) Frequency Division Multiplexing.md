**Frequency Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (FDM) Frequency Division Multiplexing|FDM]])** is a method of sending multiple signals over a single communication channel by allocating each signal a unique frequency band within the channel's available spectrum. Each signal is modulated onto a separate carrier frequency, and all are transmitted simultaneously.

[[Def - (FDM) Frequency Division Multiplexing|FDM]] is commonly used in:
- **Radio and TV broadcasting**: Each station has its own frequency.
- **Cable TV**: Different channels are carried on different frequency bands.
- **Analogue telephony**: Multiple calls are carried over a shared line using separate frequency ranges.

At the receiving end, filters are used to isolate and extract each signal based on its frequency.

Key features of [[Def - (FDM) Frequency Division Multiplexing|FDM]]:
- **Simultaneous transmission**: All signals are sent at once, without waiting for time slots.
- **Continuous bandwidth usage**: Suitable for constant data streams like voice and video.
- **Requires guard bands**: Small gaps between channels prevent interference, slightly reducing efficiency.

[[Def - (FDM) Frequency Division Multiplexing|FDM]] is an analogue technique, but its principles are also used in digital systems, such as [[Def - (OFDM) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|OFDM]] in broadband networks.
