**International Telecommunication Union ([[Def - (ITU) International Telecommunication Union|ITU]])** is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for issues related to information and communication technologies ([[Def - (ICT) Information and Communication Technologies|ICT]]). It plays a central role in the global coordination of telecommunications standards, spectrum management, and the promotion of digital inclusion.

Founded in 1865, the [[Def - (ITU) International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] is one of the oldest international organisations and is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. It brings together 193 Member States and over 900 private-sector companies, academic institutions, and regional organisations.

The ITU is organised into three main sectors:
- **[[Def - (ITU-R) ITU Radiocommunication Sector|ITU-R]] (Radio-communication Sector)**: Manages the global radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbits, ensuring interference-free operation of wireless systems.
- **[[Def - (ITU-T) ITU Telecom Standardisation Sector|ITU-T]] (Telecommunication Standardisation Sector)**: Develops international standards (known as Recommendations) that ensure interoperability and performance across telecommunication networks and services.
- **[[Def - (ITU-D) ITU Development Sector|ITU-D]] (Telecommunication Development Sector)**: Supports developing countries in building [[Def - (ICT) Information and Communication Technologies|ICT]] infrastructure and policy, promoting equitable access to communication technologies.

Key functions of the [[Def - (ITU) International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]:
- **Standardisation**: Establishes technical standards to enable global communication and compatibility across networks and equipment.
- **Spectrum allocation**: Coordinates international use of the radio spectrum, including frequencies for mobile, satellite, broadcasting, and maritime services.
- **Global collaboration**: Provides a forum for governments and industry to collaborate on global [[Def - (ICT) Information and Communication Technologies|ICT]] policy and development.
- **Capacity building**: Helps countries develop regulatory frameworks, infrastructure, and skills to close the digital divide.

The [[Def - (ITU) International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] is instrumental in advancing global initiatives such as broadband access, 5G, cybersecurity, and emergency telecommunications, and it supports the global governance of digital infrastructure.
