**Erbium-Doped Fibre Amplifier ([[Def - (EDFA) Erbium-Doped Fibre Amplifier|EDFA]])** is an optical amplifier used in fibre-optic communication systems to boost the strength of light signals directly, without converting them into electrical form. It uses a short section of optical fibre doped with the rare-earth element erbium (Er³⁺), which can amplify light in the 1550 nm wavelength range, a range where optical fibre loss is minimal.

The [[Def - (EDFA) Erbium-Doped Fibre Amplifier|EDFA]] operates by combining three components:
- **Erbium-doped fibre**: A special type of fibre infused with erbium ions.
- **Pump laser**: Provides energy (usually at 980 nm or 1480 nm) to excite the erbium ions.
- **Wavelength division coupler**: Combines the incoming signal and pump laser light into the doped fibre.

When the weak optical signal passes through the doped fibre, the excited erbium ions transfer energy to the signal light, amplifying it through **stimulated emission**.

Key advantages of [[Def - (EDFA) Erbium-Doped Fibre Amplifier|EDFA]]s:
- **All-optical amplification**: No need to convert signals to electrical and back, preserving speed and efficiency.
- **High gain and low noise**: Supports long-distance transmission without significant signal degradation.
- **Compatibility with [[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]]**: Can amplify multiple wavelengths simultaneously, making it ideal for high-capacity systems.

[[Def - (EDFA) Erbium-Doped Fibre Amplifier|EDFA]]s are widely used in long-haul, metro, and submarine fibre networks to extend reach and reduce the need for expensive regeneration equipment. They are essential to the performance and scalability of modern optical communication infrastructure.
