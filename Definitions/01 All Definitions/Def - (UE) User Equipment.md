**User Equipment ([[Def - (UE) User Equipment|UE]])** refers to the devices used by end users to connect to mobile networks. This includes smartphones, tablets, laptops with cellular modems, IoT devices, and fixed wireless terminals. The [[Def - (UE) User Equipment|UE]] communicates wirelessly with the **Radio Access Network ([[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]])** using protocols and frequencies defined by the mobile standard (e.g. [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]], [[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]]).

[[Def - (UE) User Equipment|UE]]s handle both **control plane** (signalling and session management) and **user plane** (actual data transfer) functions. They interact with the base station ([[Def - (eNodeB) Evolved NodeB|eNodeB]] or [[Def - (gNB) Next Generation NodeB|gNB]]) and the core network to establish, maintain, and release connections.

Key capabilities of [[Def - (UE) User Equipment|UE]]s:
- **Mobility support**: Seamless handovers between cells.
- **Multi-band operation**: Connect to various frequency bands, including 5G [[Def - (mmWave) millimetre wave|mmWave]] and sub-6 GHz.
- **Power-saving features**: Techniques like DRX (Discontinuous Reception) to preserve battery life.

[[Def - (UE) User Equipment|UE]] performance and compatibility are essential for ensuring good coverage, speed, and reliability in mobile communication.
