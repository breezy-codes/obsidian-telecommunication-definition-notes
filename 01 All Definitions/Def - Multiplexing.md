**[[Def - Multiplexing|Multiplexing]]** is a technique used in telecommunications to combine multiple signals or data streams into one shared communication channel. This allows more efficient use of the available bandwidth and reduces the need for separate transmission lines for each signal.

The combined signal is transmitted as a single stream, and at the receiving end, a process called **demultiplexing** separates the signals back into their original forms.

Common types of multiplexing include:
- **Time Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (TDM) Time Division Multiplexing|TDM]])**: Assigns each signal a specific time slot on the channel.
- **Frequency Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (FDM) Frequency Division Multiplexing|FDM]])**: Allocates each signal a different frequency band.
- **Wavelength Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (WDM) Wavelength Division Multiplexing|WDM]])**: Used in optical networks, where each signal is carried on a different wavelength of light.
- **Code Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (CDM) Code Division Multiplexing|CDM]])**: Each signal uses a unique code to share the same channel simultaneously.

[[Def - Multiplexing|Multiplexing]] improves network efficiency, reduces infrastructure costs, and enables the transmission of multiple services, such as voice, video, and data, over a single link.
