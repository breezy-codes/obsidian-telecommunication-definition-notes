**Optical Transport Network ([[Def - (OTN) Optical Transport Network|OTN]])** is a digital transport technology used in modern optical networks to carry large volumes of data efficiently and reliably. It provides a standardised way to wrap various types of client signals, such as Ethernet, [[Def - (SDH) Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]], or Fibre Channel, into a common optical frame for long-distance transmission.

[[Def - (OTN) Optical Transport Network|OTN]] adds features like forward error correction ([[Def - (FEC) Forwarding Equivalence Class|FEC]]), performance monitoring, and strong framing, which improve signal integrity and simplify management across the network.

Key features of [[Def - (OTN) Optical Transport Network|OTN]]:
- **Signal encapsulation**: Maps client data into optical containers without changing the original signal.
- **Forward error correction**: Detects and corrects bit errors during transmission, increasing distance and reliability.
- **Transparency**: Preserves the original format and timing of client signals.
- **Multiplexing**: Supports combining multiple lower-rate signals into higher-rate optical channels.

[[Def - (OTN) Optical Transport Network|OTN]] is often used in core and metro networks to deliver high-capacity services with better monitoring and protection than basic optical systems. It's sometimes referred to as "digital wrapper" technology and defined by [[Def - (ITU) International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]-T standards (e.g. G.709).
