**Internet Engineering Task Force ([[Def - (IETF) Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]])** is an open international community that develops and maintains the core standards and protocols of the internet. Its work ensures that the internet functions smoothly, securely, and interoperably across different systems and networks.

[[Def - (IETF) Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] produces **RFCs (Request for Comments)**, which document technical specifications and best practices for internet technologies such as:
- **[[Def - (TCP) Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]/[[Def - (IP) Internet Protocol|IP]]**
- **[[Def - (BGP) Border Gateway Protocol|BGP]]**
- **[[Def - (DNS) Domain Name System|DNS]]**
- **HTTP and HTTPS**
- **[[Def - (IPv4) Internet Protocol version 4|IPv4]] and [[Def - (IPv6) Internet Protocol version 6|IPv6]]**

Key principles of the [[Def - (IETF) Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]:
- **Open participation**: Anyone can contribute to working groups or attend meetings.
- **Rough consensus and running code**: Emphasises practical solutions and community agreement.
- **Layered design**: Encourages modular and flexible protocol development.

The [[Def - (IETF) Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] is central to the ongoing evolution of the internet, from basic connectivity to modern cybersecurity and routing protocols.
