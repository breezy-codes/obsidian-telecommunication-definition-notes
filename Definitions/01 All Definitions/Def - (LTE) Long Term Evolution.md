**Long Term Evolution ([[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]])** is a fourth-generation (4G) mobile network standard designed to provide high-speed data and low-latency connectivity for smartphones, tablets, and other wireless devices. It was developed by [[Def - (3GPP) 3rd Generation Partnership Project|3GPP]] as the evolution of [[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]/[[Def - (HSPA) High-Speed Packet Access|HSPA]].

[[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]] uses **[[Def - (OFDMA) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access|OFDMA]]** for downlink and **[[Def - (SC-FDMA) Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access|SC-FDMA]]** for uplink, allowing for efficient and robust transmission even in challenging environments.

Key features of [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]]:
- **High data rates**: Up to hundreds of Mbps in the downlink and uplink.
- **Low latency**: Suitable for real-time applications like video calls and online gaming.
- **Flat IP architecture**: Simplifies the network, improving performance and reducing costs.
- **Scalable bandwidth**: Can operate on various spectrum sizes (e.g. 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz).

[[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]] marked a major leap in mobile capabilities, enabling smooth video streaming, fast downloads, and the foundation for newer technologies like [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]]-Advanced and 5G.
