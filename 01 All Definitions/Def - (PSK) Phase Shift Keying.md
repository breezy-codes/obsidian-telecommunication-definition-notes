**Phase Shift Keying ([[Def - (PSK) Phase Shift Keying|PSK]])** is a digital modulation technique in which the **phase** of a carrier wave is varied to represent binary or multi-level data. The most basic form is **Binary PSK (BPSK)**, where two phase states (e.g. 0° and 180°) represent ‘0’ and ‘1’.

More advanced versions include:
- **QPSK (Quadrature [[Def - (PSK) Phase Shift Keying|PSK]])**: Uses four phase shifts (e.g. 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) to represent two bits per symbol.
- **8-PSK** and higher orders: Represent more bits per symbol, increasing data rate at the cost of higher noise sensitivity.

[[Def - (PSK) Phase Shift Keying|PSK]] is widely used in wireless and satellite communications due to its spectral efficiency and robustness under moderate noise.

Key benefits:
- **Efficient use of bandwidth**
- **Adaptable to different data rates**
- **Widely supported in modern digital communication systems**

Phase-based modulation is foundational in many systems, including WiFi, satellite links, and 4G/5G networks.
