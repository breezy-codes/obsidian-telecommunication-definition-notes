**Enhanced Mobile Broadband ([[Def - (eMBB) Enhanced Mobile Broadband|eMBB]])** is one of the three primary use cases defined for **5G**, focusing on delivering high-speed, high-capacity wireless data to support demanding applications like ultra-HD video streaming, VR/AR, and fast mobile internet.

Key goals of [[Def - (eMBB) Enhanced Mobile Broadband|eMBB]]:
- **Gigabit-class data rates** for users in both urban and rural environments.
- **High capacity** in dense areas like stadiums, airports, and city centres.
- **Seamless experience** across various environments—indoor, outdoor, and on the move.

Technologies that support [[Def - (eMBB) Enhanced Mobile Broadband|eMBB]] include:
- **Massive MIMO ([[Def - (mMIMO) Massive MIMO|mMIMO]]) and beamforming**
- **[[Def - (mmWave) millimetre wave|mmWave]] spectrum**
- **Carrier aggregation ([[Def - (CA) Carrier Aggregation|CA]]) and dynamic spectrum sharing**

[[Def - (eMBB) Enhanced Mobile Broadband|eMBB]] represents the most immediate and visible benefit of 5G for consumers, building on 4G [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]]’s success with significantly greater speed and responsiveness.
