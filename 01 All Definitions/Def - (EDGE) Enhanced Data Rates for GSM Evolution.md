**[[Def - (EDGE) Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] (Enhanced Data Rates for [[Def - (GSM) Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] Evolution)** is a 2.75G mobile technology that improves data transmission rates over existing [[Def - (GSM) Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] networks. It builds upon **GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)** and introduces more advanced modulation and coding schemes for greater efficiency.

[[Def - (EDGE) Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] uses **8PSK (8 Phase Shift Keying)** modulation, compared to GPRSâ€™s **GMSK (Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying)**, allowing each radio time-slot to carry up to three times more data. This boosts peak data rates to around **384 kbps**, supporting services like email, web browsing, and early mobile multimedia.

Key characteristics of [[Def - (EDGE) Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]]:
- **Backward-compatible**: Works over existing [[Def - (GSM) Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] infrastructure with software upgrades and new radios.
- **Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC)**: Dynamically adjusts the modulation and coding based on radio conditions to maintain optimal throughput.
- **Low deployment cost**: Provided higher data rates without needing new spectrum or major hardware changes.

[[Def - (EDGE) Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] served as a critical transitional technology between 2G and 3G networks, offering improved data performance while leveraging widespread GSM coverage.
