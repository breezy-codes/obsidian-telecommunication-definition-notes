**Carrier Aggregation ([[Def - (CA) Carrier Aggregation|CA]])** is a key feature in [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]]-Advanced and 5G that allows mobile networks to increase throughput and improve spectrum efficiency by combining multiple frequency carriers into a single data channel. This provides higher data rates to users and better utilisation of fragmented spectrum holdings.

Each component carrier (CC) can belong to the same or different frequency bands and may have different bandwidths. Carrier Aggregation supports both intra-band (within the same band) and inter-band (across different bands) configurations.

Key benefits of [[Def - (CA) Carrier Aggregation|CA]]:
- **Higher peak data rates**: Aggregate bandwidths up to 100 MHz in [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]] and beyond in 5G.
- **Load balancing and traffic distribution**: Dynamic assignment across carriers.
- **Improved user experience**: Especially in dense urban areas with spectrum constraints.

[[Def - (UE) User Equipment|UE]]s must support [[Def - (CA) Carrier Aggregation|CA]] to benefit from its advantages, and not all combinations are supported on all devices. The use of [[Def - (CA) Carrier Aggregation|CA]] is critical for maximising capacity and maintaining quality of service in modern mobile networks.
