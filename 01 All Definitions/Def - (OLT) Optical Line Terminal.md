**Optical Line Terminal ([[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]])** is the central device in a Passive Optical Network ([[Def - (PONs) Passive Optical Networks|PON]]) located at the service provider’s central office or exchange. It acts as the main controller and traffic aggregator, managing all communications between the provider’s core network and the end-user devices ([[Def - (ONU) Optical Network Unit|ONU]]s or [[Def - (ONTs) Optical Network Terminals|ONT]]s).

The [[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]] handles both downstream (from provider to users) and upstream (from users to provider) traffic. It broadcasts data downstream to all users and manages upstream transmissions using techniques like Time Division Multiple Access ([[Def - (TDMA) Time Division Multiple Access|TDMA]]) to avoid collisions.

Key functions of the [[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]]:

- **Traffic scheduling**: Allocates upstream time slots to [[Def - (ONU) Optical Network Unit|ONU]]s to manage shared bandwidth.
- **Signal conversion**: Converts electrical signals from the provider network into optical signals and vice versa.
- **Provisioning and monitoring**: Configures services, monitors performance, and handles fault detection.

The [[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]] is critical in delivering broadband services over fibre networks and supports technologies like GPON, XG-PON, and NG-PON2.
