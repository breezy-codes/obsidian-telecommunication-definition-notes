**Filtered Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (F-OFDM) Filtered Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|F-OFDM]])** is a waveform technique developed to enhance traditional [[Def - (OFDM) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|OFDM]] by applying filtering to specific sub-bands. It is designed to meet the diverse and flexible spectrum requirements of next-generation mobile networks like **5G**.

In standard [[Def - (OFDM) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|OFDM]], all subcarriers are tightly packed and orthogonal, but the overall signal can generate spectral leakage into adjacent bands. [[Def - (F-OFDM) Filtered Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|F-OFDM]] introduces filtering to individual sub-bands (groups of subcarriers), which reduces **out-of-band emissions** and allows multiple services to coexist in the same spectrum without interference.

This makes it well-suited to 5G environments, where different users and applications may require different bandwidths, latency, or reliability.

Key benefits of [[Def - (F-OFDM) Filtered Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|F-OFDM]]:
- **Spectrum flexibility**: Supports services with different bandwidths in neighbouring channels.
- **Improved coexistence**: Minimises interference between adjacent services or technologies.
- **Backward compatibility**: Builds on standard [[Def - (OFDM) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|OFDM]] designs, easing integration with existing systems.

[[Def - (F-OFDM) Filtered Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|F-OFDM]] enables more dynamic and efficient spectrum use, making it ideal for heterogeneous 5G services such as enhanced broadband, low-latency communication, and massive IoT.
