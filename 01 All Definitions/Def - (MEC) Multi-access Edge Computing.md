**Multi-access Edge Computing ([[Def - (MEC) Multi-access Edge Computing|MEC]])** is an architectural concept that brings cloud computing capabilities closer to the user by deploying compute, storage, and network resources at the **edge** of the mobile network, such as at base stations or edge data centres.

[[Def - (MEC) Multi-access Edge Computing|MEC]] reduces latency, improves responsiveness, and offloads traffic from the core network, enabling new low-latency and bandwidth-intensive applications in areas like:
- **Autonomous vehicles**
- **AR/VR and immersive media**
- **Industrial automation**
- **Smart cities and IoT analytics**

Key benefits of [[Def - (MEC) Multi-access Edge Computing|MEC]]:
- **Low latency**: By processing data closer to the user, it meets the needs of time-critical applications.
- **Context awareness**: Edge nodes can use local information (e.g. location, network conditions) to optimise service delivery.
- **Scalability and efficiency**: Reduces load on centralised data centres and backhaul links.

[[Def - (MEC) Multi-access Edge Computing|MEC]] plays a vital role in 5G by enabling **[[Def - (URLLC) Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications|URLLC]]** services and supporting the **service-based architecture** model. It can be integrated with virtualised network functions ([[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s) and orchestrated as part of an [[Def - (NFV) Network Functions Virtualisation|NFV]]/[[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]]-based network.
