**Open Shortest Path First ([[Def - (OSPF) Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]])** is a widely used interior gateway protocol ([[Def - (IGP) Interior Gateway Protocol|IGP]]) for routing packets within a single autonomous system. It uses a **link-state** approach, where routers exchange information about their local links and construct a complete map of the network.

[[Def - (OSPF) Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]] routers calculate the shortest path to each destination using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and build routing tables based on this topology.

Key characteristics of [[Def - (OSPF) Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]]:
- **Fast convergence**: Quickly adapts to changes in network topology.
- **Hierarchical design**: Supports areas to scale large networks and reduce routing overhead.
- **Cost-based metrics**: Chooses paths based on configurable link costs, not just hop count.
- **Support for [[Def - (VLSM) Variable-Length Subnet Masking|VLSM]]**: Handles variable-length subnet masking and [[Def - (CIDR) Classless Inter-Domain Routing|CIDR]] efficiently.

[[Def - (OSPF) Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]] is typically used in enterprise networks and large service provider infrastructures where fast, efficient, and loop-free routing is required within a controlled environment.
