**Virtual Network Functions ([[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s)** are software-based implementations of traditional network functions, such as firewalls, routers, load balancers, or [[Def - (VPN) Virtual Private Network|VPN]] gateways, that run on virtualised infrastructure instead of dedicated hardware appliances.

[[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s are a core component of **Network Functions Virtualisation ([[Def - (NFV) Network Functions Virtualisation|NFV]])** and enable service providers to deploy, scale, and manage network services flexibly using standard servers or cloud platforms.

Examples of [[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s include:
- Virtual routers (vRouters)
- Virtual firewalls (vFWs)
- Virtual Evolved Packet Core (vEPC) for mobile networks

Key benefits of [[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s:
- **Hardware independence**: Run on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware.
- **Scalability**: Can be scaled up or down based on demand.
- **Service agility**: Rapidly deploy new services without physical installations.

[[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s are often used in combination with orchestration systems to automate lifecycle tasks like deployment, scaling, and monitoring in virtualised and cloud-native environments.
