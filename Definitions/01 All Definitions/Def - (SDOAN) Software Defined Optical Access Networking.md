**Software Defined Optical Access Networking ([[Def - (SDOAN) Software Defined Optical Access Networking|SDOAN]])** extends [[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]] principles to the optical access layer, such as Passive Optical Networks ([[Def - (PONs) Passive Optical Networks|PON]]s), enabling centralised and programmable control over access networks that connect homes, businesses, and edge devices to the broader internet.

Traditional access networks rely on fixed, manual configurations and are often slow to adapt to changing user demands. [[Def - (SDOAN) Software Defined Optical Access Networking|SDOAN]] introduces an [[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]] controller that manages optical line terminals ([[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]]s), [[Def - (ONU) Optical Network Unit|ONU]]s, and other access components through standard APIs, allowing for faster service deployment and flexible network management.

A typical [[Def - (SDOAN) Software Defined Optical Access Networking|SDOAN]] setup includes:
- **Application layer**: Broadband services, network slicing, or policy enforcement apps.
- **Control layer**: A controller that translates service intent into configurations for the access network.
- **Access infrastructure layer**: Fibre-based access devices such as [[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]]s, splitters, and [[Def - (ONU) Optical Network Unit|ONU]]s.

Benefits of [[Def - (SDOAN) Software Defined Optical Access Networking|SDOAN]] include:
- **Service agility**: Quickly provision or modify broadband services without manual reconfiguration.
- **Multi-tenancy and slicing**: Support multiple operators or services over the same physical infrastructure.
- **Cost savings**: Simplifies operations and reduces reliance on proprietary vendor systems.
- **Scalability**: Better handles growing demand for fibre broadband in residential and enterprise deployments.

[[Def - (SDOAN) Software Defined Optical Access Networking|SDOAN]] is a key enabler for next-generation broadband platforms, supporting flexible, high-capacity, and software-driven access networks.
