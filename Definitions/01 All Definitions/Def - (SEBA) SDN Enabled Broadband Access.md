**SDN Enabled Broadband Access ([[Def - (SEBA) SDN Enabled Broadband Access|SEBA]])** is a reference design developed by the **Open Networking Foundation ([[Def - (ONF) Open Networking Foundation|ONF]])** to create open, disaggregated, and software-defined broadband access networks. [[Def - (SEBA) SDN Enabled Broadband Access|SEBA]] applies [[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]] principles to fibre-based access technologies like Passive Optical Networks ([[Def - (PONs) Passive Optical Networks|PON]]), aiming to simplify management and improve flexibility.

SEBA disaggregates traditional broadband systems into separate, modular components that are centrally controlled by an [[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]] controller and orchestrated through open-source platforms. It supports both residential and enterprise services over a unified infrastructure.

Key features of [[Def - (SEBA) SDN Enabled Broadband Access|SEBA]]:
- **Open interfaces**: Promotes interoperability between access hardware and control software.
- **Cloud-native architecture**: Built using containerised microservices and Kubernetes.
- **Integration with VOLTHA**: Uses the [[Def - (ONF) Open Networking Foundation|ONF]]â€™s Virtual [[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]] Hardware Abstraction layer to manage [[Def - (PONs) Passive Optical Networks|PON]] devices.

[[Def - (SEBA) SDN Enabled Broadband Access|SEBA]] enables broadband providers to reduce vendor lock-in, improve automation, and deliver faster service innovation.
