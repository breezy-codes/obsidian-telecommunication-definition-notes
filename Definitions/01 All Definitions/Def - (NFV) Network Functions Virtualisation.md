**Network Functions Virtualisation ([[Def - (NFV) Network Functions Virtualisation|NFV]])** is a network architecture approach that replaces dedicated hardware appliances (like routers, firewalls, or load balancers) with **software-based network functions ([[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s)** running on standard servers. It enables more flexible, scalable, and cost-effective network deployment and management.

[[Def - (NFV) Network Functions Virtualisation|NFV]] decouples the network functions from proprietary hardware and allows them to run in virtualised environments, often as part of a cloud-native architecture.

Key components of [[Def - (NFV) Network Functions Virtualisation|NFV]]:
- **[[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s (Virtual Network Functions)**: Software modules that perform traditional networking roles.
- **NFV Infrastructure ([[Def - (NFVI) NFV Infrastructure|NFVI]])**: The physical and virtual resources (compute, storage, network) that host [[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s.
- **[[Def - (MANO) Management and Orchestration|MANO]] (Management and Orchestration)**: Controls the lifecycle and coordination of [[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s and resources.

Benefits of [[Def - (NFV) Network Functions Virtualisation|NFV]]:
- **Reduced hardware costs**: Runs on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers.
- **Faster service deployment**: Network functions can be created, updated, and scaled dynamically.
- **Vendor flexibility**: Encourages interoperability and open standards.

[[Def - (NFV) Network Functions Virtualisation|NFV]] is widely used in 5G, enterprise networks, and cloud service delivery, enabling agile and automated network operations.
