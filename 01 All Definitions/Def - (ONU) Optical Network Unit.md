**Optical Network Unit ([[Def - (ONU) Optical Network Unit|ONU]])** is a device located at or near the end-user premises in a Passive Optical Network ([[Def - (PONs) Passive Optical Networks|PON]]). It receives data from the Optical Line Terminal ([[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]]) and converts it into a format suitable for home or business networks, such as Ethernet.

The [[Def - (ONU) Optical Network Unit|ONU]] is typically installed at the building entry point or on a kerbside node and may serve one or multiple users. In residential deployments, it is often called an **Optical Network Terminal ([[Def - (ONTs) Optical Network Terminals|ONT]])** when it connects directly to a single household.

Key functions of the [[Def - (ONU) Optical Network Unit|ONU]]:
- **Downstream reception**: Filters and processes the data sent by the [[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]], delivering only the intended information to the user.
- **Upstream transmission**: Sends user data back to the [[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]] during assigned time slots.
- **Interface bridging**: Converts optical signals into electrical signals and provides interfaces like Ethernet, WiFi, or telephone.

[[Def - (ONU) Optical Network Unit|ONU]]s enable high-speed broadband delivery and are a core part of [[Def - (FTTH) Fibre to the Home|FTTH]], FTTB, and other fibre access architectures.
