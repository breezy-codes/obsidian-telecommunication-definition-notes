**Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access ([[Def - (OFDMA) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access|OFDMA]])** is a multi-user version of [[Def - (OFDM) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|OFDM]] used in wireless networks to allow multiple users to transmit simultaneously. It works by dividing the available bandwidth into many narrow sub-carriers and assigning subsets of them to different users in a dynamic and efficient way.

Unlike regular [[Def - (OFDM) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|OFDM]], where one user occupies all sub-carriers at a time, [[Def - (OFDMA) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access|OFDMA]] allows parallel access for many users, making it highly efficient for data-heavy and variable-demand environments.

Key features of [[Def - (OFDMA) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access|OFDMA]]:
- **Multiple user support**: Assigns sub-carriers per user based on need and channel conditions.
- **Flexible resource allocation**: Dynamically adapts to user demand and signal quality.
- **Low latency and high throughput**: Ideal for real-time and high-bandwidth services.

[[Def - (OFDMA) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access|OFDMA]] is used in technologies such as 4G [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]] (downlink), [[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]], and WiFi 6.
