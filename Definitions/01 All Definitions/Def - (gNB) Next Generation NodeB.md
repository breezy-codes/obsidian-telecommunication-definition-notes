**[[Def - (gNB) Next Generation NodeB|gNB]] (Next Generation NodeB)** is the base station in a **[[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]]** network, responsible for handling radio communications between user devices ([[Def - (UE) User Equipment|UE]]s) and the 5G core network. It replaces the **[[Def - (eNodeB) Evolved NodeB|eNodeB]]** used in 4G [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]] and supports more advanced features tailored to 5G performance requirements.

A [[Def - (gNB) Next Generation NodeB|gNB]] typically consists of:
- **Centralised Unit ([[Def - (CU) Centralised Unit|CU]])**: Handles higher-layer functions like mobility management and session control.
- **Distributed Unit ([[Def - (DU) Distributed Unit|DU]])**: Manages lower-layer functions like radio scheduling and [[Def - (MAC) Medium Access Control|MAC]] processing.
- **Radio Unit ([[Def - (RU) Radio Unit|RU]])**: Handles the physical transmission and reception of radio signals.

Key features of [[Def - (gNB) Next Generation NodeB|gNB]]:
- **Split architecture**: Supports centralised or distributed deployment for flexible network design.
- **[[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]] support**: Operates with a 5G core (SA mode) or 4G core (NSA mode).
- **Advanced radio features**: Supports [[Def - Beamforming|beamforming]], massive MIMO ([[Def - (mMIMO) Massive MIMO|mMIMO]]), and dynamic spectrum sharing.

[[Def - (gNB) Next Generation NodeB|gNB]]s are essential for delivering the full capabilities of 5G, including higher data rates, lower latency, and support for diverse services across industries.
