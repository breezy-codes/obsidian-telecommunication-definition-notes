**Code Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (CDM) Code Division Multiplexing|CDM]])** is a technique where multiple signals share the same frequency band and time by using unique codes to distinguish each signal. It is the basis for Code Division Multiple Access ([[Def - (CDMA) Code Division Multiple Access|CDMA]]), used in mobile networks and satellite communications.

Each signal is spread across the entire available bandwidth using a specific code. At the receiver, the same code is used to extract the desired signal, while other signals appear as noise and are ignored.

Key features of [[Def - (CDM) Code Division Multiplexing|CDM]]:
- **Shared channel use**: All users transmit simultaneously over the same frequency range.
- **Code separation**: Orthogonal or pseudo-random codes ensure signals donâ€™t interfere with each other.
- **Resilience to interference**: [[Def - (CDM) Code Division Multiplexing|CDM]] performs well in noisy or congested environments.
- **Security and privacy**: Spreading makes the signal harder to intercept or jam.

[[Def - (CDM) Code Division Multiplexing|CDM]] is used in systems like 3G mobile networks ([[Def - (WCDMA) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access|WCDMA]]), GPS, and some military communication systems, where robust, simultaneous access is needed.
