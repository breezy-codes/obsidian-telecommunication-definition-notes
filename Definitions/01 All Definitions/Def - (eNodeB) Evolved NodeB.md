**[[Def - (eNodeB) Evolved NodeB|eNodeB]] (Evolved NodeB)** is the base station used in **4G [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]]** networks. It handles all radio-related functions between mobile devices and the **Evolved Packet Core ([[Def - (EPC) Evolved Packet Core|EPC]])**, including transmission, scheduling, handovers, and mobility management.

Unlike earlier generations, [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]] integrates most of the radio network control directly into the [[Def - (eNodeB) Evolved NodeB|eNodeB]], removing the need for a separate controller like the 3G RNC (Radio Network Controller).

Key responsibilities of the [[Def - (eNodeB) Evolved NodeB|eNodeB]]:
- **Radio resource management**
- **Scheduling and link adaptation**
- **Mobility support and handover control**
- **Encryption and integrity protection**

[[Def - (eNodeB) Evolved NodeB|eNodeB]]s can also participate in **Non-Standalone (NSA)** 5G deployments, where they connect to **[[Def - (gNB) Next Generation NodeB|gNB]]s** to provide combined 4G/5G coverage. They remain a crucial part of mobile networks, especially in areas where 5G has not yet been fully deployed.
