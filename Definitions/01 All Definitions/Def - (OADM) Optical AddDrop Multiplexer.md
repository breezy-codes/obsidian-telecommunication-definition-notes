**Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer ([[Def - (OADM) Optical AddDrop Multiplexer|OADM]])** is a key element in wavelength-division multiplexing ([[Def - (WDM) Wavelength Division Multiplexing|WDM]]) optical networks, enabling selective access to individual wavelengths (channels) within a multiplexed optical signal. It allows specific wavelengths to be **added** (inserted) or **dropped** (removed) at intermediate nodes without converting the entire optical signal to the electrical domain.

[[Def - (OADM) Optical AddDrop Multiplexer|OADM]]s are used to:
- **Insert local traffic** onto a specific wavelength within a fibre.
- **Extract selected wavelengths** for local delivery while allowing others to pass through transparently.
- **Support reconfigurable networking**: Some [[Def - (OADM) Optical AddDrop Multiplexer|OADM]]s ([[Def - (ROADM) Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer|ROADM]] â€“ Reconfigurable OADM) allow dynamic configuration of wavelengths without manual intervention.

Benefits of [[Def - (OADM) Optical AddDrop Multiplexer|OADM]]s include:
- **Improved scalability**: Add capacity without laying new fibre.
- **Reduced electrical processing**: Save energy and equipment costs.
- **Support for optical bypass**: Enables transit traffic to remain in the optical domain, improving efficiency.

[[Def - (OADM) Optical AddDrop Multiplexer|OADM]]s are essential in long-haul and metro optical transport networks, playing a central role in flexible, cost-efficient [[Def - (WDM) Wavelength Division Multiplexing|WDM]] systems for modern telecommunications.
