**Software-Defined Wide Area Network ([[Def - (SD-WAN) Software-Defined Wide Area Network|SD-WAN]])** is an advanced [[Def - (WAN) Wide Area Network|WAN]] architecture that uses **software-defined networking ([[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]])** principles to manage and optimise [[Def - (WAN) Wide Area Network|WAN]] traffic across multiple transport links, such as [[Def - (MPLS) Multi-Protocol Label Switching|MPLS]], broadband internet, [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]], or satellite.

Unlike traditional [[Def - (WAN) Wide Area Network|WAN]]s that rely heavily on fixed routing and expensive leased lines, [[Def - (SD-WAN) Software-Defined Wide Area Network|SD-WAN]] offers:
- **Dynamic path selection**: Routes traffic based on real-time conditions like latency, jitter, and packet loss.
- **Centralised control**: Network policies are managed through a central controller, reducing complexity.
- **Application-aware routing**: Prioritises business-critical or latency-sensitive applications (e.g. [[Def - (VoIP) Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]], video conferencing).
- **Improved security**: Integrates with firewalls, [[Def - (VPN) Virtual Private Network|VPN]]s, and encryption to secure data across untrusted links.

[[Def - (SD-WAN) Software-Defined Wide Area Network|SD-WAN]] enables enterprises and mobile operators to:
- **Lower costs**: By leveraging cheaper transport links while maintaining performance.
- **Increase agility**: Rapidly deploy new sites or services.
- **Improve cloud access**: By directly routing to cloud services instead of backhauling through data centres.

It is particularly valuable in hybrid and distributed environments, and is increasingly being used alongside 5G and edge computing deployments.
