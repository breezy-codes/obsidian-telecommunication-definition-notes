**Ultra-Reliable Machine-Type Communications ([[Def - (uMTC) Ultra-Reliable Machine-Type Communications|uMTC]])** is one of the three main service categories defined for 5G networks (alongside [[Def - (eMBB) Enhanced Mobile Broadband|eMBB]] and [[Def - (mMTC) Massive Machine-Type Communications|mMTC]]). It is designed to support applications requiring extremely high reliability, low latency, and deterministic communication. These characteristics are essential for critical use cases such as industrial automation, intelligent transport systems, and remote control of machinery.

[[Def - (uMTC) Ultra-Reliable Machine-Type Communications|uMTC]] enables communication with latency as low as 1 ms and reliability of 99.999% or higher. To achieve this, it uses advanced scheduling, redundant transmissions, and diversity techniques, often in conjunction with edge computing to minimise processing delays.

Key use cases for [[Def - (uMTC) Ultra-Reliable Machine-Type Communications|uMTC]]:
- **Factory automation**: Real-time control of robotic systems and sensors.
- **Autonomous and connected vehicles**: Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.
- **Healthcare**: Remote surgery and other time-critical medical procedures.

Unlike traditional mobile communication, [[Def - (uMTC) Ultra-Reliable Machine-Type Communications|uMTC]] focuses on predictable performance under strict requirements, even in highly dynamic or congested environments. It represents a major step forward in enabling cyber-physical systems that depend on wireless connectivity for mission-critical tasks.
