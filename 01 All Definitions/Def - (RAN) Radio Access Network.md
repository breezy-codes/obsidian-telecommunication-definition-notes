**Radio Access Network ([[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]])** is the part of a mobile network that connects end-user devices, like smartphones, tablets, or IoT sensors, to the core network. It handles all radio-related functions including signal transmission, reception, handover, and resource allocation.

A typical [[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]] consists of:
- **Radio Units ([[Def - (RU) Radio Unit|RU]]s)**: Transmit and receive radio signals over the air interface.
- **Distributed Units ([[Def - (DU) Distributed Unit|DU]]s)**: Handle lower-layer processing like scheduling and error correction.
- **Centralised Units ([[Def - (CU) Centralised Unit|CU]]s)**: Manage higher-layer tasks like mobility management and security.

[[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]]s can be implemented in different ways:
- **Traditional (integrated) RAN**: Vendor-specific, tightly coupled hardware and software.
- **Open RAN ([[Def - (O-RAN) Open Radio Access Network|O-RAN]])**: Disaggregated and interoperable components with open interfaces.
- **Cloud RAN ([[Def - (C-RAN) Centralised Radio Access Network|C-RAN]])**: Centralised processing in virtualised or cloud infrastructure.

The [[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]] is essential to delivering wireless connectivity and is one of the most performance-sensitive parts of the mobile network, especially in 5G, where demands for speed, latency, and device density are much higher.
