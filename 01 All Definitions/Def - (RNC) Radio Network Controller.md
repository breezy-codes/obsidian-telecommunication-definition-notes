**Radio Network Controller ([[Def - (RNC) Radio Network Controller|RNC]])** was a key component in **3G ([[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]])** networks, responsible for managing radio resources and controlling multiple [[Def - (eNodeB) Evolved NodeB|eNodeB]]s (base stations). It acted as the intermediary between the **core network** and the **Radio Access Network ([[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]])**, handling tasks such as mobility, handovers, encryption, and resource allocation.

Functions of the [[Def - (RNC) Radio Network Controller|RNC]] included:
- **Call setup and teardown**
- **Handover management** between [[Def - (eNodeB) Evolved NodeB|eNodeB]]s
- **Load balancing and radio resource control**
- **Packet scheduling and QoS enforcement**

In **4G [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]]**, the [[Def - (RNC) Radio Network Controller|RNC]] was removed, and its functions were absorbed into the **[[Def - (eNodeB) Evolved NodeB|eNodeB]]**, leading to a flatter and more efficient architecture. [[Def - (RNC) Radio Network Controller|RNC]]s are no longer used in modern networks but were critical for the operation and scalability of 3G systems.
