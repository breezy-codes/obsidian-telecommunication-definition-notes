**[[Def - (ITU-R) ITU Radiocommunication Sector|ITU-R]] (ITU Radio communication Sector)** is the branch of the **International Telecommunication Union ([[Def - (ITU) International Telecommunication Union|ITU]])** responsible for managing the international radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbit resources. It ensures equitable access and interference-free operation of radio communication systems across countries and services.

[[Def - (ITU-R) ITU Radiocommunication Sector|ITU-R]] develops **Recommendations and Reports** that guide the technical and regulatory aspects of wireless communication, including:
- **Spectrum allocation and planning**
- **Terrestrial and satellite services** (e.g. mobile, broadcasting, fixed, amateur radio)
- **Propagation models and radio wave characteristics**
- **International coordination of frequency use**

Key characteristics of [[Def - (ITU-R) ITU Radiocommunication Sector|ITU-R]]:
- **Spectrum management**: Oversees global radio-frequency and orbital allocations to avoid harmful interference.
- **WRC leadership**: Organises the **World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC)**, where key decisions on spectrum policy are made.
- **Scientific foundation**: Collaborates with research institutions and national administrations to ensure evidence-based policies.

Through its work, [[Def - (ITU-R) ITU Radiocommunication Sector|ITU-R]] supports the efficient use of wireless technologies, enabling services like satellite navigation, 5G, and broadcasting to coexist on a global scale.
