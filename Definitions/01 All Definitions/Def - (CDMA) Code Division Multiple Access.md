**Code Division Multiple Access ([[Def - (CDMA) Code Division Multiple Access|CDMA]])** is a channel access method used in mobile and wireless communication that allows multiple users to share the same frequency band and time by assigning each user a unique code. Instead of separating signals by time or frequency, [[Def - (CDMA) Code Division Multiple Access|CDMA]] spreads each user’s data over the entire bandwidth using that code.

All users transmit simultaneously over the same channel, but at the receiver, the original signal is recovered by applying the matching code. Other users’ signals appear as low-level noise and are ignored.

Key features of [[Def - (CDMA) Code Division Multiple Access|CDMA]]:
- **Shared spectrum**: All users use the full frequency range at all times.
- **Unique codes**: Each user is assigned a pseudo-random code to distinguish their signal.
- **Resilience to interference**: Works well in noisy or congested environments.
- **Soft capacity limit**: More users can be added, but quality may degrade gradually.

[[Def - (CDMA) Code Division Multiple Access|CDMA]] was widely used in 2G and 3G mobile networks, such as **cdmaOne** and **CDMA2000**, especially in North America and parts of Asia. It laid the groundwork for more advanced techniques like [[Def - (WCDMA) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access|WCDMA]] and [[Def - (OFDMA) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access|OFDMA]] used in later mobile generations.
