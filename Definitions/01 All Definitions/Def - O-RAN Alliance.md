**[[Def - O-RAN Alliance|O-RAN Alliance]]** is an international industry group focused on transforming the Radio Access Network ([[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]]) through open interfaces, virtualisation, and intelligent control. Its goal is to enable more flexible, cost-effective, and vendor-neutral mobile network deployments by promoting **Open RAN** architectures.

[[Def - (O-RAN) Open Radio Access Network|O-RAN]] splits traditional, monolithic [[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]] systems into interoperable components such as:
- **Radio Units ([[Def - (RU) Radio Unit|RU]]s)**
- **Distributed Units ([[Def - (DU) Distributed Unit|DU]]s)**
- **Centralised Units ([[Def - (CU) Centralised Unit|CU]]s)**

These components communicate through standardised, open interfaces defined by the alliance, allowing operators to mix and match equipment from different vendors.

Key initiatives of the [[Def - O-RAN Alliance|O-RAN Alliance]]:
- **O-RAN Architecture**: Defines modular, software-based [[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]] elements.
- **Open interfaces**: Promotes interoperability between components.
- **RAN Intelligent Controller ([[Def - (RIC) RAN Intelligent Controller|RIC]])**: Supports real-time and non-real-time optimisation using AI/ML.

[[Def - (O-RAN) Open Radio Access Network|O-RAN]] enables innovation, lowers deployment costs, and improves adaptability, especially important for 5G, rural, and private network use cases.
