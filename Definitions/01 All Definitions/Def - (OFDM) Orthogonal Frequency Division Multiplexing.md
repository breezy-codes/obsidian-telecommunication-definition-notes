**Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (OFDM) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|OFDM]])** is a digital modulation and multiplexing technique that divides a high-speed data stream into many slower sub-streams, each transmitted on a different, closely spaced frequency. These sub-carriers are mathematically orthogonal, meaning they do not interfere with each other, even though they overlap in frequency.

[[Def - (OFDM) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|OFDM]] is highly resistant to signal degradation caused by multi-path fading and interference, making it ideal for wireless and high-speed environments.

Key features of [[Def - (OFDM) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|OFDM]]:
- **Efficient spectrum use**: Sub-carriers overlap without interfering, maximising bandwidth use.
- **Robustness**: Handles reflections and delays well, improving performance in urban or indoor settings.
- **Simplified equalisation**: Converts complex frequency-selective channels into many flat sub-channels.

[[Def - (OFDM) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing|OFDM]] is widely used in modern communication systems, including:
- **WiFi (802.11a/g/n/ac)**
- **4G LTE**
- **Digital TV broadcasting (DVB)**
- **DSL broadband**

It forms the foundation of many high-speed wireless and wired technologies due to its flexibility and robustness.
