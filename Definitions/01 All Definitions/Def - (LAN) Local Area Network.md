**Local Area Network ([[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]])** is a **private network** that interconnects computers, devices, and systems within a **limited geographic area**, such as a home, office, school, or data centre. [[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]]s are designed for **high-speed, low-latency communication** over relatively short distances and are typically owned and operated by a single organisation or individual.

[[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]]s enable resource sharing (files, printers, internet access), communication (VoIP, video conferencing), and centralised management of users and devices.

Key characteristics of [[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]]s:
- **Geographically confined**: Usually spans a single building or campus.
- **High bandwidth**: Supports fast data transfer rates (e.g. 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps+).
- **Low latency**: Enables real-time services such as streaming and gaming.
- **Private [[Def - (IP) Internet Protocol|IP]] addressing**: Commonly uses RFC 1918 address ranges (e.g. `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`).
- **Broadcast domain**: All devices on a [[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]] can receive broadcast messages unless segmented by VLANs.

[[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]] technologies include:
- **Ethernet**: The dominant wired [[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]] protocol, typically using switches and UTP cables.
- **WiFi (IEEE 802.11)**: The primary wireless [[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]] standard, enabling mobility within the coverage area.
- **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**: Logical segmentation within a [[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]] to improve security and performance.

[[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]]s are essential in nearly all digital environments, forming the **foundation of enterprise and home networks**. They are typically connected to **Wide Area Networks ([[Def - (WAN) Wide Area Network|WAN]]s)** via routers to access external services such as the internet.
