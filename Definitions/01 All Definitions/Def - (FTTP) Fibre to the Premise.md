**Fibre to the Premise ([[Def - (FTTP) Fibre to the Premise|FTTP]])** is a broadband network architecture in which optical fibre is installed all the way from the network provider’s central office to the boundary or interior of a customer’s property. It is a general term that includes both **Fibre to the Home ([[Def - (FTTH) Fibre to the Home|FTTH]])** and **Fibre to the Business (FTTB)**.

[[Def - (FTTP) Fibre to the Premise|FTTP]] provides a full end-to-end fibre connection, eliminating the need for legacy copper or coaxial cables in the access segment. This allows for much higher data rates, improved reliability, and future scalability.

Depending on the deployment, [[Def - (FTTP) Fibre to the Premise|FTTP]] can involve:
- **[[Def - (FTTH) Fibre to the Home|FTTH]] (Fibre to the Home)**: Fibre reaches individual residential dwellings.
- **FTTB (Fibre to the Building or Basement)**: Fibre reaches a multi-dwelling unit or commercial building, with internal cabling distributing the service to occupants.

Key benefits of [[Def - (FTTP) Fibre to the Premise|FTTP]]:
- **High-speed access**: Supports symmetrical upload and download speeds in the gigabit range and beyond.
- **Low latency**: Ideal for time-sensitive applications like video conferencing, online gaming, and remote work.
- **Long-term performance**: Fibre has a long lifespan and can support increasing bandwidth demands over time.
- **Reduced maintenance**: Less susceptible to interference, water damage, and wear compared to copper-based systems.

[[Def - (FTTP) Fibre to the Premise|FTTP]] is a key enabler of modern digital infrastructure and is used by many national broadband initiatives to deliver future-ready connectivity to homes, businesses, and community facilities.
