**3rd Generation Partnership Project ([[Def - (3GPP) 3rd Generation Partnership Project|3GPP]])** is a global collaboration between groups of telecommunications standards organisations. It develops protocols for mobile systems across multiple generations, including 3G ([[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]), 4G ([[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]]), and [[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]].

[[Def - (3GPP) 3rd Generation Partnership Project|3GPP]] produces detailed technical specifications covering:

- **Radio access technologies** (e.g. [[Def - (WCDMA) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access|WCDMA]], [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]], [[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]])
- **Core networks** and system architecture
- **Security, charging, and QoS mechanisms**

Key aspects of [[Def - (3GPP) 3rd Generation Partnership Project|3GPP]]:

- **Global standardisation**: Ensures interoperability across countries and vendors.
- **Release system**: Specifications are published in releases (e.g. Release 8 for [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]], Release 15 for early 5G).
- **Industry-driven**: Members include telecom operators, equipment vendors, and researchers.

[[Def - (3GPP) 3rd Generation Partnership Project|3GPP]] plays a central role in shaping the mobile ecosystem, from handset design to how networks operate worldwide.
