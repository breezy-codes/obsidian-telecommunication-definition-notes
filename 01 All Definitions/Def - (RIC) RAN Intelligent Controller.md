**RAN Intelligent Controller ([[Def - (RIC) RAN Intelligent Controller|RIC]])** is a key component of the **[[Def - (O-RAN) Open Radio Access Network|O-RAN]] architecture** that enables programmable, intelligent control of the **Radio Access Network ([[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]])**. It is responsible for optimising [[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]] behaviour using real-time data, analytics, and automation, often with AI and machine learning techniques.

There are two main types of [[Def - (RIC) RAN Intelligent Controller|RIC]]:
- **Near-Real-Time RIC (near-RT RIC)**: Operates on a timescale of 10 ms to 1 s, enabling functions like interference management, load balancing, and handover optimisation.
- **Non-Real-Time RIC (non-RT RIC)**: Operates over longer timescales (seconds to hours), providing policy guidance, training models, and handling lifecycle management.

Key benefits of the [[Def - (RIC) RAN Intelligent Controller|RIC]]:
- **Vendor-neutral control**: Interfaces with components from different vendors via standardised APIs.
- **Programmability**: Supports third-party applications (xApps and rApps) for network optimisation.
- **Improved performance and efficiency**: Adapts to traffic and user behaviour dynamically.

The [[Def - (RIC) RAN Intelligent Controller|RIC]] plays a central role in making the [[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]] more flexible, intelligent, and responsive to the demands of 5G networks.
