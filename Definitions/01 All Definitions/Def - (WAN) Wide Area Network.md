**Wide Area Network ([[Def - (WAN) Wide Area Network|WAN]])** is a type of telecommunications network that spans a large geographic area, connecting multiple Local Area Networks ([[Def - (LAN) Local Area Network|LAN]]s), data centres, or branch offices. [[Def - (WAN) Wide Area Network|WAN]]s enable communication and resource sharing across cities, regions, or even globally.

[[Def - (WAN) Wide Area Network|WAN]]s are typically built using leased lines, fibre optics, satellite links, or public internet infrastructure, depending on the coverage area and service requirements. They are used by enterprises, service providers, and governments to connect remote locations securely and reliably.

Key characteristics of [[Def - (WAN) Wide Area Network|WAN]]s:
- **Long-distance connectivity**: From inter-city to intercontinental links.
- **Scalability**: Can grow to support thousands of devices and sites.
- **Protocol diversity**: Supports multiple communication protocols like [[Def - (MPLS) Multi-Protocol Label Switching|MPLS]], [[Def - (IPsec) Internet Protocol Security|IPSec]], or GRE.
- **Performance variability**: Often depends on carrier services and physical media.

[[Def - (WAN) Wide Area Network|WAN]]s are essential for business continuity, cloud access, remote work, and interconnecting mobile network infrastructure such as [[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]], core, and data centres.
