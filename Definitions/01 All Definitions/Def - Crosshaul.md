**[[Def - Crosshaul|Crosshaul]], also known as x-haul** is an architectural concept in next-generation mobile networks where **[[Def - Fronthaul|fronthaul]]** and **[[Def - Backhaul|Backhaul]]** traffic are **converged onto a common transport infrastructure**. Instead of maintaining separate physical and logical networks for these traffic types, crosshaul enables integrated and dynamic handling of both.

This convergence allows operators to treat all [[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]] traffic uniformly, using shared resources and intelligent transport management to reduce cost, complexity, and latency. It supports the needs of flexible, software-defined, and cloud-native networks, especially in 5G and beyond.

Key features of [[Def - Crosshaul|Crosshaul]]:
- **Unified infrastructure**: Combines [[Def - Fronthaul|fronthaul]], [[Def - Midhaul|midhaul]], and [[Def - Backhaul|backhaul]] into a single fabric.
- **Dynamic resource allocation**: Bandwidth and latency resources are allocated based on service requirements.
- **[[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]] and [[Def - (NFV) Network Functions Virtualisation|NFV]] integration**: Enables real-time traffic engineering and centralised control.
- **Supports mobile edge computing ([[Def - (MEC) Multi-access Edge Computing|MEC]])**: By dynamically routing traffic to nearby edge nodes when appropriate.

[[Def - Crosshaul|Crosshaul]] is essential for efficient 5G deployments and aligns with the goals of transport network disaggregation, supporting services like [[Def - (URLLC) Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications|URLLC]] and [[Def - (mMTC) Massive Machine-Type Communications|mMTC]] across a common transport plane.
