**High-Speed Packet Access ([[Def - (HSPA) High-Speed Packet Access|HSPA]])** is an enhancement to [[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] networks that significantly improves data speeds and responsiveness. It includes two components:

- **HSDPA** (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access) for faster downloads
- **HSUPA** (High-Speed Uplink Packet Access) for faster uploads

Together, they are often referred to as **HSPA** or **HSPA+** when further enhanced. [[Def - (HSPA) High-Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] upgrades are software-based and allowed carriers to extend the life of their 3G infrastructure before moving to 4G.

Key features of [[Def - (HSPA) High-Speed Packet Access|HSPA]]:
- **Higher data rates**: Up to 14 Mbps downlink and 5.8 Mbps uplink, even higher with HSPA+.
- **Improved latency**: Faster response times for mobile browsing and apps.
- **Backward compatible**: Works alongside existing [[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] networks.

[[Def - (HSPA) High-Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] bridged the performance gap between 3G and early 4G systems, offering a faster and smoother mobile internet experience.
