**Centralised Radio Access Network ([[Def - (C-RAN) Centralised Radio Access Network|C-RAN]])** is an architectural approach in which the baseband processing units of multiple cell sites are centralised into a shared location, rather than being located at each individual cell tower. This centralised pool connects to distributed radio units ([[Def - (RU) Radio Unit|RU]]s) via high-speed fronthaul links, typically using fibre.

By consolidating processing into a **Baseband Unit ([[Def - (BBU) Baseband Unit|BBU]]) pool**, [[Def - (C-RAN) Centralised Radio Access Network|C-RAN]] improves resource utilisation, simplifies network upgrades, and enables better coordination between cells for techniques like **[[Def - (CoMP) Coordinated Multipoint|CoMP]] (Coordinated Multipoint)**.

Key benefits of [[Def - (C-RAN) Centralised Radio Access Network|C-RAN]]:
- **Cost efficiency**: Reduces equipment and maintenance at remote sites.
- **Improved performance**: Centralisation allows tighter control over interference and handovers.
- **Energy savings**: Consolidated infrastructure is easier to cool and manage.
- **5G readiness**: Serves as a foundation for virtualised and cloud-based [[Def - (RAN) Radio Access Network|RAN]]s.

[[Def - (C-RAN) Centralised Radio Access Network|C-RAN]] supports flexible and scalable mobile network deployments, particularly in urban and high-density environments.
