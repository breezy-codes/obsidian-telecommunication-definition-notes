**Open Disaggregated Transport Network ([[Def - (ODTN) Open Disaggregated Transport Network|ODTN]])** is a project led by the **Open Networking Foundation ([[Def - (ONF) Open Networking Foundation|ONF]])** that applies open and disaggregated principles to the optical transport layer of telecom networks. It separates hardware (such as transponders, [[Def - (ROADM) Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer|ROADM]]s, and amplifiers) from the control and management software, enabling a mix of equipment from different vendors.

[[Def - (ODTN) Open Disaggregated Transport Network|ODTN]] aims to simplify optical network deployment and management through [[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]] control and standardised APIs. It integrates with tools like **[[Def - (ONOS) Open Network Operating System|ONOS]]** (Open Network Operating System) to orchestrate and control transport services.

Key characteristics of [[Def - (ODTN) Open Disaggregated Transport Network|ODTN]]:
- **Hardware disaggregation**: Mix and match open line systems and terminal equipment.
- **Programmability**: Uses [[Def - (SDN) Software Defined Networking|SDN]] to control optical path provisioning and fault recovery.
- **Open source stack**: Leverages open platforms for fast innovation and community collaboration.

[[Def - (ODTN) Open Disaggregated Transport Network|ODTN]] is designed to improve the cost-effectiveness, scalability, and adaptability of optical transport in both metro and long-haul networks.
