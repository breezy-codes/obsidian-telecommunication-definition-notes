**Fibre to the Home ([[Def - (FTTH) Fibre to the Home|FTTH]])** is a broadband network architecture where optical fibre is used to deliver high-speed internet, television, and voice services directly from the service provider to individual residences. Unlike traditional copper-based technologies, [[Def - (FTTH) Fibre to the Home|FTTH]] provides end-to-end fibre connectivity, enabling much higher bandwidth and better signal quality.

In an [[Def - (FTTH) Fibre to the Home|FTTH]] setup, the fibre typically runs from the provider's central office or exchange to an **Optical Network Terminal ([[Def - (ONTs) Optical Network Terminals|ONT]])** located at or near the customerâ€™s premises. This is often part of a **Passive Optical Network ([[Def - (PONs) Passive Optical Networks|PON]])**, which uses passive splitters to share a single fibre among multiple homes, reducing infrastructure costs.

[[Def - (FTTH) Fibre to the Home|FTTH]] offers several advantages over legacy access technologies like DSL or coaxial cable:
- **Higher speeds**: Capable of supporting gigabit and multi-gigabit connections, suitable for streaming, gaming, remote work, and future applications.
- **Longer reach**: Fibre signals can travel much farther without degradation compared to electrical signals over copper.
- **Lower latency and interference**: Optical signals are less affected by electromagnetic noise and signal crosstalk.
- **Better reliability and future-proofing**: Fibre has a long service life and can support growing bandwidth demands for decades.

[[Def - (FTTH) Fibre to the Home|FTTH]] is considered the gold standard for fixed broadband access and plays a critical role in enabling smart homes, cloud services, and digital inclusion, particularly in regions aiming to close the digital divide with fast, dependable connectivity.
