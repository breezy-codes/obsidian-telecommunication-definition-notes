**Management and Orchestration ([[Def - (MANO) Management and Orchestration|MANO]])** is a framework defined by the **[[Def - (ETSI) European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]] [[Def - (NFV) Network Functions Virtualisation|NFV]]** architecture for managing and coordinating **Virtual Network Functions ([[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s)** and the infrastructure they run on. [[Def - (MANO) Management and Orchestration|MANO]] ensures that virtual network services are deployed, maintained, and scaled efficiently across cloud or data centre environments.

The [[Def - (MANO) Management and Orchestration|MANO]] framework includes three main components:
- **NFV Orchestrator ([[Def - (NFVO) NFV Orchestrator|NFVO]])**: Manages network services and coordinates resources across multiple domains.
- **VNF Manager ([[Def - (VNFM) VNF Manager|VNFM]])**: Handles lifecycle management of individual [[Def - (VNFs) Virtual Network Functions|VNF]]s (e.g. start, stop, scale, update).
- **Virtualised Infrastructure Manager (VIM)**: Controls compute, storage, and network resources (e.g. OpenStack, Kubernetes).

Key responsibilities of [[Def - (MANO) Management and Orchestration|MANO]]:
- **Automated deployment and scaling**
- **Resource optimisation and monitoring**
- **Fault recovery and service assurance**

[[Def - (MANO) Management and Orchestration|MANO]] plays a critical role in enabling dynamic, policy-driven network operations in [[Def - (NFV) Network Functions Virtualisation|NFV]] and cloud-native telecom environments.
