**Massive Machine-Type Communications ([[Def - (mMTC) Massive Machine-Type Communications|mMTC]])** is one of the core service types defined in 5G, aimed at supporting a vast number of low-power, low-data-rate devices in applications like smart cities, agriculture, logistics, and environmental monitoring.

[[Def - (mMTC) Massive Machine-Type Communications|mMTC]] is designed to scale up to **one million devices per square kilometre**, accommodating large-scale deployment of IoT (Internet of Things) devices. These devices typically transmit small amounts of data intermittently, and must do so reliably and efficiently even in densely connected environments.

Key characteristics of [[Def - (mMTC) Massive Machine-Type Communications|mMTC]]:
- **Massive connectivity**: Handles simultaneous access from thousands to millions of devices.
- **Low energy consumption**: Enables multi-year battery life using techniques like Power Saving Mode (PSM) and extended DRX.
- **Low complexity**: Devices are simple and cost-effective, with minimal signalling overhead.
- **Broad coverage**: Support for enhanced coverage in challenging areas like basements or remote fields.

[[Def - (mMTC) Massive Machine-Type Communications|mMTC]] is critical for enabling the vision of pervasive connectivity in sectors such as smart metering, asset tracking, and environmental sensing.
