**Massive MIMO ([[Def - (mMIMO) Massive MIMO|mMIMO]])** is a wireless technology that uses large numbers of antennas, often dozens or more, at the base station to transmit and receive multiple data streams simultaneously. It is a core feature of **[[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]]**, enabling much higher capacity, better coverage, and improved spectral efficiency.

Unlike traditional [[Def - (MIMO) Multiple Input Multiple Output|MIMO]], which uses a small number of antennas (e.g. 2x2 or 4x4), [[Def - (mMIMO) Massive MIMO|mMIMO]] systems may use **64, 128, or more antennas** to serve multiple users at the same time using techniques like **beamforming** and **spatial multiplexing**.

Key benefits of [[Def - (mMIMO) Massive MIMO|mMIMO]]:
- **Increased capacity**: Supports more users and higher data rates in the same spectrum.
- **Improved coverage**: Focused beams reach farther and penetrate buildings better.
- **Spectral efficiency**: Makes better use of limited spectrum by reusing it spatially.
- **Reduced interference**: Directs energy where itâ€™s needed, minimising signal spillover.

[[Def - (mMIMO) Massive MIMO|mMIMO]] is essential for meeting the demands of dense urban areas, stadiums, and high-traffic 5G deployments.
