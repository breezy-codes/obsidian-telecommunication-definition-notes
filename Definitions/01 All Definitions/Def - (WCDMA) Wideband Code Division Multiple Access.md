**Wideband Code Division Multiple Access ([[Def - (WCDMA) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access|WCDMA]])** is a **third-generation (3G)** mobile communication technology based on **Code Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (CDM) Code Division Multiplexing|CDM]])**. It allows multiple users to access the same frequency band simultaneously by assigning each user a unique spreading code. [[05 Telecommunications/00 Definitions/Def - Multiplexing and Modulation/Def - (WCDMA) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access|WCDMA]] is a core technology in **[[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)** and was standardised by **[[Def - (3GPP) 3rd Generation Partnership Project|3GPP]]**.

Unlike previous generation technologies like GSM, which use Time Division Multiplexing ([[Def - (TDM) Time Division Multiplexing|TDM]]) or Frequency Division multiplexing ([[Def - (FDM) Frequency Division Multiplexing|FDM]]), [[Def - (WCDMA) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access|WCDMA]] spreads each user's signal over a **5 MHz bandwidth**, enabling higher data rates and better spectral efficiency.

Key features of [[Def - (WCDMA) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access|WCDMA]]:
- **Simultaneous user access**: Multiple users transmit over the same frequency spectrum using different codes.
- **Variable data rates**: Supports adaptive data rates and efficient use of radio resources.
- **Soft handover**: Maintains connections with multiple base stations during transitions, reducing call drops.
- **High capacity and coverage**: Supports a large number of users per cell with robust signal performance.
- **Support for voice and data**: Provides integrated support for voice calls, SMS, and high-speed data services.

[[Def - (WCDMA) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access|WCDMA]] enables services like:
- **Mobile internet access**
- **Video calling**
- **Multimedia messaging**
- **Streaming audio/video**

It was widely deployed globally during the 2000s and 2010s as a successor to 2G systems and remains in use today, though it is gradually being phased out in favour of **[[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]] (4G)** and **[[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]]**.
