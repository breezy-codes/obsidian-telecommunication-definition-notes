**Coordinated Multipoint ([[Def - (CoMP) Coordinated Multipoint|CoMP]])** is a set of techniques used in mobile networks to improve data rates and reliability, especially for users near cell edges. It involves coordination between multiple base stations (or transmission points) to serve a [[Def - (UE) User Equipment|UE]] simultaneously or in a coordinated manner.

[[Def - (CoMP) Coordinated Multipoint|CoMP]] can operate in different modes:
- **Joint transmission**: Multiple sites transmit the same data to a [[Def - (UE) User Equipment|UE]], improving signal strength through constructive combination.
- **Dynamic point selection**: The network dynamically chooses the best transmission point based on real-time conditions.
- **Coordinated scheduling/beamforming**: Transmission points coordinate their schedules or beam directions to reduce interference.

Key benefits of [[Def - (CoMP) Coordinated Multipoint|CoMP]]:
- **Improved coverage and throughput** at the cell edge.
- **Interference reduction** through better coordination between neighbouring sites.
- **Higher reliability** in environments with fluctuating signal quality.

[[Def - (CoMP) Coordinated Multipoint|CoMP]] is supported in [[Def - (LTE) Long Term Evolution|LTE]]-Advanced and [[Def - (5G-NR) 5G New Radio|5G-NR]] and is especially useful in dense urban areas, stadiums, and complex indoor environments.
