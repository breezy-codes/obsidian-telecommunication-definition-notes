**[[Def - (mmWave) millimetre wave|mmWave]] (millimetre wave)** refers to the portion of the radio frequency spectrum between **24 GHz and 100 GHz**, used in **5G** to deliver extremely high data rates and capacity over short distances. These frequencies have shorter wavelengths, which allow for dense spatial reuse and wide bandwidth channels (e.g. 100 MHz or more).

Key characteristics of [[Def - (mmWave) millimetre wave|mmWave]]:
- **Very high throughput**: Supports multi-gigabit speeds ideal for [[Def - (eMBB) Enhanced Mobile Broadband|eMBB]].
- **Short range**: Signal degrades quickly over distance and through obstacles like walls or glass.
- **Highly directional**: Often paired with beamforming to focus energy toward the user.

[[Def - (mmWave) millimetre wave|mmWave]] is ideal for:
- **Dense urban areas and stadiums**
- **Fixed wireless access**
- **High-capacity hotspots**

While [[Def - (mmWave) millimetre wave|mmWave]] enables some of the most impressive performance in 5G, it is typically deployed alongside sub-6 GHz bands to ensure broader coverage and more consistent service.
