**Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer ([[Def - (ROADM) Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer|ROADM]])** is a device used in [[Def - (DWDM) Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing|DWDM]] optical networks that enables dynamic routing of individual wavelengths (channels) without the need to convert optical signals to electrical signals. It allows specific wavelengths to be added, dropped, or passed through at intermediate nodes, giving the network flexibility and programmability.

Traditional optical networks required manual configuration to add or drop channels at specific locations. With a [[Def - (ROADM) Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer|ROADM]], this process becomes automated and software-controlled, allowing operators to reconfigure the network remotely and in real time.

A [[Def - (ROADM) Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer|ROADM]] can:
- **Add**: Insert new optical channels into the fibre at a node.
- **Drop**: Extract selected wavelengths for local access.
- **Pass-through**: Let remaining wavelengths continue without alteration.
- **Switch**: Redirect wavelengths to different output ports dynamically.

Modern [[Def - (ROADM) Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer|ROADM]]s use **wavelength-selective switches (WSS)** to control how channels are routed. Some [[Def - (ROADM) Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer|ROADM]]s also support **colourless**, **directionless**, and **contentionless** capabilities:
- **Colourless**: Any wavelength can be added/dropped at any port.
- **Directionless**: Wavelengths can be routed in any direction.
- **Contentionless**: Multiple signals using the same wavelength can be added/dropped simultaneously without conflict.

Advantages of [[Def - (ROADM) Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer|ROADM]] technology:
- **Operational flexibility**: Enables dynamic provisioning and reconfiguration without physical intervention.
- **Scalability**: Supports growth in demand without redesigning the network.
- **Cost efficiency**: Reduces the need for regeneration and manual rewiring.

[[Def - (ROADM) Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer|ROADM]]s are a key enabler of modern optical mesh networks, supporting high-capacity, self-healing, and software-defined transport infrastructure.
