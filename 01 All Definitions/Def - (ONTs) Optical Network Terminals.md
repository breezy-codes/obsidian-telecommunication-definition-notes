**Optical Network Terminals ([[Def - (ONTs) Optical Network Terminals|ONT]]s)** are **customer-premises devices** used in **fibre-to-the-premises ([[Def - (FTTP) Fibre to the Premise|FTTP]])** or **fibre-to-the-home ([[Def - (FTTH) Fibre to the Home|FTTH]])** broadband networks. An [[Def - (ONTs) Optical Network Terminals|ONT]] serves as the **demarcation point** between the service provider’s **Passive Optical Network ([[Def - (PONs) Passive Optical Networks|PON]])** and the end-user’s internal network.

[[Def - (ONTs) Optical Network Terminals|ONT]]s are typically deployed at residential or small business locations and are managed by the service provider. They convert **optical signals** transmitted over fibre into **electrical signals** that can be used by Ethernet, phone, or video equipment inside the premises.

Key functions of an [[Def - (ONTs) Optical Network Terminals|ONT]]:
- **Optical-electrical conversion**: Translates incoming light signals from the Optical Line Terminal ([[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]]) at the central office into usable digital formats.
- **Uplink transmission**: Converts electrical signals from the customer network into optical signals sent upstream.
- **Interface provisioning**: Provides one or more ports for Ethernet (e.g. Gigabit Ethernet), voice (POTS), and sometimes RF video.
- **Timing and synchronisation**: Ensures accurate transmission across shared fibre.
- **Security and encryption**: Supports authentication and secure communication with the [[Def - (OLT) Optical Line Terminal|OLT]].

[[Def - (ONTs) Optical Network Terminals|ONT]]s operate within the framework of a **GPON (Gigabit PON)**, **XG-PON**, or **10G-PON** system, where one fibre from the central office is split among multiple premises using passive optical splitters.

Key benefits:
- **High-speed access**: Supports gigabit and multi-gigabit broadband services.
- **Low maintenance**: Passive design on the network side means fewer points of failure.
- **Scalability**: Easily accommodates increasing bandwidth demands from homes and businesses.

[[Def - (ONTs) Optical Network Terminals|ONT]]s are sometimes integrated with home routers, in which case the combined device may be referred to as a **gateway** or **fibre modem/router**.
