**Universal Mobile Telecommunications System ([[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]])** is a third-generation (3G) mobile communication standard developed by the [[Def - (3GPP) 3rd Generation Partnership Project|3GPP]]. It provides higher data rates and improved capacity compared to 2G systems, enabling services like mobile internet, video calling, and multimedia messaging.

[[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] uses **[[Def - (WCDMA) Wideband Code Division Multiple Access|WCDMA]]** as its radio access technology, operating typically in 5 MHz channels. It supports both circuit-switched (e.g. voice) and packet-switched (e.g. internet) services.

Key features of [[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]]:
- **Higher data speeds**: Up to 384 kbps for mobile users, and higher with [[Def - (HSPA) High-Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] upgrades.
- **Global roaming**: Common standard across many countries.
- **Multimedia support**: Enables video, web browsing, and app usage over mobile.
- **Backward compatibility**: Can fall back to [[Def - (GSM) Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]]/[[05 Telecommunications/00 Definitions/Def - Wireless Technologies/Def - (EDGE) Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] in non-[[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] areas.

[[Def - (UMTS) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] was a major step in the evolution of mobile networks, bridging the gap between voice-dominated 2G systems and the data-driven 4G era.
